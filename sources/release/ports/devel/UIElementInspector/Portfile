description Shows Accessibility API elements on applications, useful when make Apple Scripts
long_description \
  In this sample, the Accessibility API is used to get information about \
  whatever AXUIElements (widgets) are under the mouse at any given time. \
  Information can be obtained from the AXUIElement, and actions that it \
  has can be performed.  As the mouse moves, the inspector window displays \
  information obtained through the new API. When you then lock the inspector \
  window on an element, you can dig deeper into the information provided by \
  the API for that object, as well as trigger any actions that it might \
  provide, in the interaction window.
